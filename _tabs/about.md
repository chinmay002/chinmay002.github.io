As a Data Science Intern at CCDS Lab, I am working on a fascinating research project that involves analyzing social media data to understand the dynamics of American elections. I am leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT to train computational models on unstructured text data of 1M records extracted from Twitter and Facebook. I am also conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis using Plotly and Seaborn, and validating and fine-tuning models using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques, achieving an F1 score of 88%.

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University, where I have excelled in coursework related to machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I am passionate about applying data science techniques to drive insights, solve complex problems, and make meaningful contributions. I have a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning architectures, and I am proficient in a wide range of data science tools, libraries, and programming languages such as Python, SQL, R, PySpark, NLTK, TensorFlow, and Git.

I have also gained valuable hands-on experience and expanded my knowledge in the field through my previous internships at INeuron.ai and Madras Research Foundation, where I worked on diverse data science projects, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and classification. I developed models using machine learning techniques, explored the exciting field of NLP, and deployed the code to cloud platforms. I am eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to collaborate with other data enthusiasts and experts. I am looking for Fall Co-op opportunities where I can apply my data science skills and knowledge to make a positive impact.
