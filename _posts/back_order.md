BackOrder Prediction

# Introduction
Backorders are unavoidable, but by anticipating which things will be backordered, planning can be streamlined at several levels, preventing unexpected strain on production, logistics, and transportation. ERP systems
generate a lot of data (mainly structured) and also contain a lot of historicaldata; if this data can be properly utilized, a predictive model to forecast backorders and plan accordingly can be constructed. Based on past data from
inventories, supply chain, and sales, classify the products as going into backorder (Yes or No).

# Proposed Solution
The proposed solution for this project is Machine learning algorithms can be implemented to predict backorder. Considering various features like inventory quantity,previous performance, minimum_balance,
forecast_sales , actual_sales etc as inputs from the web app, the implemented classification model will predict the output Here, we have used Random Forest Classifier to predict . However, drawing a baseline
model is important since it tells us how well other models have performed compared to base model.
